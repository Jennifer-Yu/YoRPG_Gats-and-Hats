##Description
We want to create a turn based RPG. The game itself will contain a hub in which the player can either enter a dungeon, where they fight a series of monsters, or a town, where players can purchase equipment and modify their character's stats. We want to implement features such as elemental weaknesses and exp into our battle system. When a player levels up, they will receive skill points which they can allocate to various skills. We also want to add a bit more excitement to our dungeons by allowing the players to choose which way to go if a "fork" appears.  In terms of player customization, characters will be able to choose an element to focus on as well as choose their strongest and weakest stats.  The town will allow the player to purchase items as well as reset their skill points.
